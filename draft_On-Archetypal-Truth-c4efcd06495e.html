The adaptation that is the human-specific mode of communication, that is symbolic speech, arose as an instrumental means to adapt to new circumstances while still furthering  the existing function of earlier evolved modes of communication that human’s still share with their ancestor mammalian species. The conservative aspect of natural selection results in a scaffolding of being, and being by its nature is hierarchical.

We could not possibly be conscious of these things and remember all of them because our mind would be so full of useless details we would be unable to think. From all this awareness we must select, and what we select and calls consciousness is never the same as the awareness because the process of selection mutates it. We take a handful of sand from the endless landscape of awareness around us and call that handful of sand the world.</blockquote><blockquote name="125e" id="125e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Once we have the handful of sand, the world of which we are conscious, a process of discrimination goes to work on it.

Shades of color in different piles…sizes in different piles…grain shapes in different piles…subtypes of grain shapes in different piles…grades of opacity in different piles…and so on, and on, and on.

Recall that an equation of the form <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">y = </em>k<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">*x</em></strong> where <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">k</strong> is some constant number and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x</em></strong> and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">y</em></strong> are variables. This implies that the variables <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x</em></strong> and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">y</em></strong> are directly proportional.

Proportionality and linearity only differ in one aspect. That is linearity has the extra characteristic of a constant (or zero) being added to the independent variable (i.e., <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">y=</em>m<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x+</em>b</strong>).</p><p name="da10" id="da10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The equation “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">extension × comprehension = information</em></strong>” can be represented symbolically as “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">e × c = i</em></strong>”, where “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">e</em></strong>”, “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">c</em></strong>”, and “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">i</em></strong>” are all real variables.

This is just sending a message. In the process errors can creep in: noise could affect the message in transit, reception could be bad, we might get glitches. Any of these could mean that the message we receive differs from the one sent: this is the so-called “communication problem in the presence of noise”. Now this isn’t exactly the same situation as with memory — which is like sending a message through time rather than space — but you can see the similarities. We store something in memory and at a later time we read it back out — in the interim the stored “message” is subject to noise. When it comes to the reliability of stored memory and sent messages there are important practical differences. It is possible in principle, for example, to continually check on the contents of our memory, whereas, if NASA sends a radio communication to a Jupiter probe there is no way of checking its contents while in transit. Nevertheless, the analogy is strong enough to make a look at communication theory worthwhile. We will start with a look at how we might go about detecting errors, an essential step before we can correct them. — <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Richard Feynman, Feynman Lectures on Computation (1996)</strong></blockquote><h4 name="124c" id="124c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote">Information Measures</h4><p name="d61c" id="d61c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">mutual information, synergistic information, the unique information and the redundant information</p><h4 name="595d" id="595d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Coding Theory</h4><p name="cd81" id="cd81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">…</p></div></div></section><section name="7a92" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="e7f7" id="e7f7" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Information Concretized</h3><p name="beb1" id="beb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Terrence Deacon’s Containment Hierarchy of Information</em></strong><br><br></p><ol class="postList"><li name="42fd" id="42fd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Shannon Information (medium capacity)</li><li name="ca50" id="ca50" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Referential Information (aboutness) [economic inference]</li><li name="e37c" id="e37c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Significant Information (usefulness)</li></ol><figure name="f346" id="f346" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*zbuj1uokGYe_Rw1Nhpp61A.jpeg" data-width="891" data-height="507" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zbuj1uokGYe_Rw1Nhpp61A.jpeg"></figure><p name="561e" id="561e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Is Everything Medium?</strong><br>When contexts (mediums) co-occur in space and time contexts contain others contexts.

This is just sending a message. In the process errors can creep in: noise could affect the message in transit, reception could be bad, we might get glitches. Any of these could mean that the message we receive differs from the one sent: this is the so-called “communication problem in the presence of noise”. Now this isn’t exactly the same situation as with memory — which is like sending a message through time rather than space — but you can see the similarities. We store something in memory and at a later time we read it back out — in the interim the stored “message” is subject to noise. When it comes to the reliability of stored memory and sent messages there are important practical differences. It is possible in principle, for example, to continually check on the contents of our memory, whereas, if NASA sends a radio communication to a Jupiter probe there is no way of checking its contents while in transit. Nevertheless, the analogy is strong enough to make a look at communication theory worthwhile. We will start with a look at how we might go about detecting errors, an essential step before we can correct them. — <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Richard Feynman, Feynman Lectures on Computation (1996)</strong></blockquote><h4 name="ecb3" id="ecb3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote">Information Measures</h4><p name="1bb0" id="1bb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">mutual information, synergistic information, the unique information and the redundant information</p><h4 name="b25d" id="b25d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Coding Theory</h4><p name="39b5" id="39b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Terrence Deacon<br>Shannon Information, Boltzmann Information, Darwin Information</p><h4 name="553b" id="553b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Adding and Subtracting</h4><p name="7006" id="7006" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Since metaphorical language is less theoretical and more practical and because of the additional constraints that come with the more “real world” focus, we are forced by the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">information bottleneck of action</em> to adapt or <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">encode</em> the information to better fit our purposes in at least two ways.

I think that the definition of a ‘theory of lie’ should be taken as a pretty comprehensive program for a general semiotics.” — Umberto Eco, A Theory of Semiotics (1976)</p><p name="ad67" id="ad67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Thomas Sebeok on Peirce and the Triadic Nature of Nature</em></strong></p><blockquote name="8d04" id="8d04" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“In his twilight years, in the course of a discussion about two kinds of indeterminacy — indefiniteness and generality — Charles Peirce explained that the former ‘‘consists in the sign’s not sufficiently expressing itself to allow of an indubitable determinate interpretation,’’ since, as he had written somewhat earlier (1906), for a sign to fulfill its office, ‘‘to actualize its potency,’’ it must be compelled (he meant in a purely physiological manner) by its object. The latter, generality, he held, ‘‘turns over to the interpreter the right to complete the determination as he please.’’ These observations, which have a direct bearing upon the question of pragmaticism, and much else — in particular, the notion of duality — besides, are immediately followed by a singularly haunting passage. The title for this volume builds upon this bedazzling sentence, one that Peirce himself might have characterized as exceedingly simple yet for that very reason most difficult to grasp: ‘<strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">‘</strong>I<strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">t seems a strange thing, when one comes to ponder over it, that a sign should leave its interpreter to supply a part of its meaning; but the explanation of the phenomenon lies in the fact that the entire universe — not merely the universe of existents, but all that wider universe, embracing the universe of existents as a part, the universe which we are all accustomed to refer to as ‘the truth’ — that all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs.’’</strong></blockquote><blockquote name="1235" id="1235" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">It fell to Jakob von Uexkiill and his successors to eventually provide the theoretical biological underpinning for Peirce’s view, which is tantamount to the assertion that in man, as in all other animals, semiosis has its source in the regulatory circuits that equilibrate and thus unify every living system (Cannon’s principle of homeostasis), as well as establishes and maintains networks of stable relationships among diverse organisms (in Jacob’s ascending hierarchy of intégrons). Semiosis must, of course, conform to the universal laws of thermodynamics, as René Thom — who was strongly influenced by both Peirce and von Uexküll — has lately shown in several landmark contributions, rooted in topology, that surely betoken the most consequential turning point in the history of semiotics since Peirce.” — <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Thomas A.

The laws of physics can be viewed as a layer of abstraction between the experimental data and the practitioners who want to use specific phenomena to achieve their goals, without having to worry about the specifics of the experiments and the data that inspired the laws. Abstractions are constructed with a particular set of goals in mind, and they apply when appropriate constraints are met. For example, Newton’s laws of motion are simple statements that relate the dynamics of rigid bodies to their masses and external forces. They apply under certain constraints, for example, when the velocities are much smaller than the speed of light. Scientific abstractions, or laws such as Newton’s, are simple and easy to use, and enable us to harness and use the properties of nature.</blockquote><blockquote name="3ef7" id="3ef7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">…</blockquote><blockquote name="0aaa" id="0aaa" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">The set of abstractions that transition from science to engineering and insulate the engineer from scientific minutiae are often derived through the discretization discipline. Discretization is also referred to as lumping. A discipline is a self-imposed constraint. The discipline of discretization states that we choose to deal with discrete elements or ranges and ascribe a single value to each discrete element or range. Consequently, the discretization discipline requires us to ignore the distribution of values within a discrete element. Of course, this discipline requires that systems built on this principle operate within appropriate constraints so that the single-value assumptions hold. As we will see shortly, the lumped circuit abstraction that is fundamental to electrical engineering and computer science is based on lumping or discretizing matter. Digital systems use the digital abstraction, which is based on discretizing signal values. Clocked digital systems are based on discretizing both signals and time, and digital systolic arrays are based on discretizing signals, time and space. <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">— Anant Agarwal, Jeffrey Lang, </em>Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> (2005)</em></strong></blockquote><h4 name="6732" id="6732" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote">Indirect Communication Through Layers of Abstraction</h4><p name="2c59" id="2c59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The USPS Address/Mailing System</em></strong></p><p name="8f72" id="8f72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Say Alice, a resident of Los Angeles, California, sends Bob, a resident of Austin, Texas, a package through the mail.

Also I first need to consume more of Jonathan’s content to learn more about his perspective before I can comment on it in any quality way. What follows are some of my recent ideas on this distinction (hopefully it isn’t way off base).</p><p name="b268" id="b268" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Communication in general serves many purposes. So when we employ literal or metaphorical language we do so for different purposes. More precisely metaphorical language serves <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">more</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">purposes</em> than literal mode of communication.</p><p name="c861" id="c861" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is a tangentially related paragraph from an article I wrote on reason [edited]:</p><blockquote name="2807" id="2807" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Rhetoric is the art of persuasion. Compared to logic it is a </em>more general discipline<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> and it is closer to the domain of practice and action, i.e., less theoretical and abstract. As a result the meaning of “a reason” is now widened to any communication that convinces you of a belief whatsoever. In this context, in addition striving for something like scientific and logical truth (see correspondence theory of truth) that perfectly describes nature or “carves nature at its joints”, </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">we have additional purposes in mind</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">. This is due to the additional constraints that come with a more “real world” or action-oriented perspective like ethical value, efficiency-oriented constraints like pragmatic applicability (actionable knowledge) and memorability (mnemonics) and memetic virality. The theoretical subdisciplines already adopt some relatively rhetorical modes already, for example </em>mathematical elegance<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> aka what I term the aesthetics of logic (aesthetic constraints on logical norms).</em></blockquote><p name="c62c" id="c62c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">An attempt to classify communicative purpose could be (1) <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to inform</em>, (2) <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to effect practically</em>, and (3) <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to impress an aesthetic feeling, </em>and these imply many other subgoals. For example to effect practically the communicatee needs to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">learn </em>&amp; <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">remember </em>the communication (learnability &amp; mnemonics) and to be able to apply it easily (actionability).</p><p name="b430" id="b430" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess am trying to sort of amalgamate literal language with scientific truth and metaphoric language with religious truth. What I am getting at is that the literal or scientific mode works by abstracting away our other purposes. So it is an isolated form of truth that tries to not remove any informative information whatsoever (a trade off between extent of goals and precision of information). I am speculating but I also think it might also be true to say that, at least until recently, literal language and scientific truth <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">tends</em> to disregard scale and interlevel communication (there are exceptions).</p><p name="6f21" id="6f21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since metaphorical language is less theoretical and more practical and because of the additional constraints that come with the more “real world” focus, we are forced to adapt the information to better fit our purposes in two ways. First by <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">abstracting</em> away (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noopener noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">lossy compression</a>) some relevant information (but “the least relevant of the relevant” info). Second adapts the information by <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">adding</em> mnemonic information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaborative_encoding" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaborative_encoding" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noopener noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">elaborative encoding</a>). Notice here I’m talking about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">non-redundant</em> information. I’m not sure what to say about the removal of much actually redundant information at this moment but I think in both literal and metaphorical language that would happen as it would be generally useful.</p><p name="fac0" id="fac0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So in summary literal language serves less purposes (basically <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">only</strong> “carving nature at its joints” + precision) which leads to more a different means of coding. The mistake was in thinking that they served the same single purpose.</p><p name="9086" id="9086" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One more thing there should be a third category that is missing from this distinction (a synthesis of the two) but I can’t grasp it quite yet. I think it might be something like the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">scale-oriented or fractal precise frame</strong>.

There is this idea in religion but also in science and technology the entire universe becomes one entity, a Cosmic<br>Christ, a Celestial Buddha, a Universal Vishnu. This is not just religion. Ray Kurzweil the technologists talks about the same idea and also Frank Tipler the physicist, the same idea that the entire universe becomes one entity.</blockquote><blockquote name="cf45" id="cf45" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">In the same way the human race doesn’t become one peaceful global village or one horrible world tyranny through one step. There’s basically intermediate steps of tribes, kingdoms, nation-states. The universe doesn’t become the Cosmic Christ through one jump. There’s basically planetary consciousness, interstellar consciousness, galactic consciousness, intergalactic consciousnesses to the absolute cosmic consciousness.</blockquote><blockquote name="e398" id="e398" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Now you see what we have here is Russian dolls. Within the cosmic whole there is a kind of intermediate consciousnesses, to the unified planetary consciousness, to life-forms/human beings. The idea is basically that the universe is a Russian doll that actually reflects the processes of the brain and vice versa, and the brain reflects the processes of society in the universe. But also that the Russian doll of the universe also contains all the Russian dolls of our minds. So there’s one all-encompassing cosmic Russian doll of all life and all consciousness. This is the very ancient idea of the cosmic tree, this all-encompassing kind of unified structure of all existence. This is the idea that corresponds of this E=MC² of the brain theory and what the theory gives is a kind of language to basically support this ancient idea.</blockquote><blockquote name="abda" id="abda" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Now what’s of interest basically is what I call the new physics or the latest science is really converging with this idea.</blockquote><blockquote name="cd16" id="cd16" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">A fractal universe, this is the paradigm of the age. Fractals are everywhere. Fractal forms are the norm in the universe. Complexity theory, the study of complex things, life, societies, etc. in science, and the quest for a unified theory of complexity. Also the idea of evolution as a master theory. This idea that evolution is the master. Some people even say that evolution is before the laws of logic, that the laws of logic evolve. I don’t believe it. I mean some people believe that laws of physics come out from the laws of evolution and also that universes compete. So evolution as this master theories. Its almost as if evolutionists have rejected God and they’ve made evolution God. It’s kind of idolatry, isn’t it? Anyway evolution as this master theory. But there is also the idea that evolution is going on in our brains. There is actually an idea in science right now e.g, memes, neural Darwinism and genetic algorithms.</blockquote><blockquote name="ee04" id="ee04" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Now a huge paradigm which is really taking the science world by storm is the informational computational universe, and recent research has basically quantized space and time in the same way to energy is quantized in quantum mechanics.</blockquote><blockquote name="b47e" id="b47e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">What I’d say is all these cutting-edge ideas in science the new physics is really convergent with the brain theory.

If you extrapolate the brain theory, the brain is purposeful and meaningful (things in our minds are meaningful and purposeful) so if extrapolate the brain theory, into the universe what you restore to science and cosmology is teleology, purpose and meaning.

vein the Buddha within Sikh holy texts adi granth the one God is all pervading alone dwells in the mind so God has imminence but yet God is transcendent transcends physical matter in this universe but untouched by the universe and touched by order goings on in the universe exactly the properties of consciousness there’s nothing more imminent imminent to you than your consciousness close to you then your jugular vein but also consciousness is transcendent they can’t reduce consciousness to physical matter so the idea that there’s one consciousness and that you are it’s that God is one that the greatest commandment and Judaism here o Israel and logic God is one the greatest commandment in Christianity because Jesus was asked what’s the greatest commandment he says hear o Israel all decoders the love of God Lord is one Bhagavad-Gita super-soul God inside you quote appears divided but is never divided and has always situated as one an idea that God is one but so we are one that’s in Christ as no dude there’s no Greek and there is no slave when Christ we’re all one that Allah has created you from one sold at your creation and your resurrection is but that of a single soul not otherwise that summer we are all one person even in a John Lennon lyric I am he as you are he and you and me and we’re all together get a cast off his head a host a fact that means sort of truth describers and modern Gnostic okay drank the chi kyon and saw interesting things and wrote interesting lyrics good songs and then not so good songs you had to recover from woody uh it’s good songwriting inspired by we took in anyway um so God is one we are one the oneness of God and one is that we are is one in same so socially tell you that your God if you didn’t know really that’s the ya know going to explain how does everyone’s God now it’s not just saying it could need to explain it now need to need to qualify because some people here are going to say but hey I didn’t notice an re what you’re talking about is everyone is God thing I didn’t I teach you didn’t Turkish there’s nothing about this in religion surely so I need explained as two kinds of religion there’s what’s called exoteric religion what we normally understand is religion this is what we see churches synagogues mosques etc Bible get bag the guitar Quran this is the aspect of religion where there is division and also the aspect of religion which will never reconcile science and also annexed the exoteric mysteries exoteric religion also includes those many faceted aspects of religion that people dismiss and think that’s all religions about so religion and all these aspects are true but they’re parts of the puzzled did that indeed religion can be opium the people can be a way of controlling people and way of a means of social cohesion and it also religion contains a narrative form astrological and astronomical phenomena and then people say oh but that’s all it is that these are aspects are not not mutually exclusive so religion is multifaceted and there’s all these things but it’s also something that’s completely been missed by most people most the the Hawking’s of this world of Dawkins the John graves of this world militant atheists is an aspect called the esoteric side of religion and specially the esoteric side is alluded to in all religions the hidden teachings of Moses the hidden take teachings of Buddha Jesus in the Bible the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven happens in parables to everyone else it’s it’s a mystery so they’re ever seeing never perceiving ever hearing never understanding lusion — hidden mysteries but when we go into these hidden mysteries we see the truth spoken directly in the Sufi traditions of favorite Sufis saying of Muhammad man is my mystery and I’m his ministry for I’m he himself in his I myself in the Gnostic Gospels of Thomas Jesus says drink from my mouth and you shall be as I and I shall be as you and the hidden things — you shall be revealed so in the hidden mysteries of religion we have this idea that yes we have these prophets that claim to be God but they’re saying to everyone is God the reason why you have esoteric mysteries is because they’re hidden because one in the past if you said these mysteries you were killed it says massive incentive not to say them and also from four years for all for all history these mysteries could not be explained that’s changed we can now explain fully in a way that scientists and philosophers can understand how does everyone’s God now and two things have happened to make this possible one is a thing called the the man that brought sets now the one thing about materialism is that we have to account for the physical world isn’t ok that all the contradictions say that materialism is flawed philosophers Descartes Kant Berkeley Dahl say we can never know the physical world we can own our consciousness therefore can only assume that the physical world except we can never know it and also in religion Meir sannyasa that somehow it’s illusory you know Plato’s cave but we have to explain what’s behind the illusion we have to explain account for the physical world now this has been very hard it’s been kind of stumbling block of idealism the other alternative the materialism how do you account for the physical world now a discovery in 75 the Mandelbrot set really gives us an insight into the nature of a physical world essentially the recovery of a very ancient idea now this just the man that brought set it’s basically a kind of very famous fractal now I told you this is the the overall Mandelbrot set some mathematical objects now this mathematical object is infant the complex and it contains an infinity of the information and detail that’s staggering I mean basically that’s the entire set what we can do is I can zoom in on bits say say the little box our zoom in on it see and now our zoom in on that that little box there lumen on it okay I can do it to infinity so I can keep doing it up there look I can zoom in on etc etc etc now what if I told you that that entire Mandelbrot set no smoke no mirrors nothing random going on that entire infinity of information and detail is contained in a single equation now it took manda brought in the mid-70s to discover it because you need to animate that equation thousands of times thousands of times they’ve rendered one pixel of the picture of the Mandelbrot set so you couldn’t do by hand you needed powerful computers to do it and manda brought happened to work for IBM she had access to powerful computers now did he discover this or did he invent it<br>surely Mandelbrot didn’t invent orders patent econ fkd this infinity of beauty so he must have discovered it but even if it discovered the man that brought says where did the man that brought set exist before he discovered it now the answer is it exists platonically or mathematically there’s a mathematical realm of existence where these objects exist and the universe could end and we begin again but Amanda brought set will exist in this kind of transcendent mathematical realm and always exists now it’s a very simple idea that there is this idea of mathematical existence but idea that basically there’s a close relationship between a universe and mathematics very ancient idea Pythagoras the ancient mystical stage said that universe is a number Galileo book of nature is written in language of mathematics Isaac Newton God as a mathematician this occurring idea somehow there’s a close relationship between mathematics and physical universe Eugene Dignity Nobel prize-winning physicist the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and describing the physical world now the proposition is is that the nature of physical existence is mathematical the reason why does such a close relationship between mathematics in the physical universe and also between you know because science and mathematics in the universe is because the nature of physical distance and also donate is also the same as the nature of mathematical existence and that’s that’s a very ancient idea because it’s the idea that the entire physical universe and all physical universes are contained in this equation of all existence of all possible universes and as a very ancient idea now some physicists even speculate that this equation exists Paul Davis in<br>a mind of God talks about an equation that contains not just or different virtual equations of laws of motion etc but also contains all the initial conditions which you can calculate the universe from beginning to end but also Pythagoras we talked about earlier who brought the mysteries from Egypt to Greece he the universes number now Plato platonic existence Plato is described as a Pythagorean and then Plato’s ideas were developed by Danny Oh place earnest so lineage of ideas Pythagoras Plato Neo-Platonists and Neo-Platonists idea of the logos found its way into the Bible it’s translated as the word and the often here in the Queen’s speech in beginning the first lines of John Gospel Freemason favorite apparently in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and word is God the Word was with God and beginning through the words all food a word all things were made without the word nothing was made has been made but we understand the word logos comes from a lineage of ideas from the Plotinus Neoplatonist effect of Pythagoras then is the same idea of this mathematical equation that contains all existence what I’m saying is is that basically with this logos we render in the same way we render animations fly throughs Mandelbrot set we render subjective experience that’s me in this room looking at you now it’s you looking at me now the subjective experience we render subjectivity not physical reality that physical reality is illusory now in this diagram by Roger Penrose he basically talks about free realms now he does plea he does believe in the Platonic realm he talks about free realms he talks about the physical world he talked about a subjective mental world and he talks about the Platonic mathematical world what I’m simply saying is basically the physical world doesn’t exist that all we have is really the logos and the one consciousness creating subjective experiences with the boss now this is this is a very shocking view of the existence it’s a view of what we saw it physicist called blocky universe means the universe from beginning to end space-time the entire universe from beginning to end as one objects now each of these dots would be order consciousnesses in the entire universe from beginning to end and that the big dot at the end is the Cosmic Consciousness celestial Buddha Universal Vishnu and every one dot for every single life form that’s ever existed from beginning of the University and the universe now that’s the materialist view of the universe from beginning to end but there’s another view and it’s the idea that you take all the beads representing every single consciousness in the universe from beginning to end and you string them out in the single chain of transmigration such that basically the universe is made up of a single consciousness traversing eternity and experiencing all things all the things that these individual consciousness see one lifetime one experience at a time now now such that at every point on the string all these consciousnesses all these life forms can experience themselves as being one of the universe becoming one with God then it’s not illusory it’s actually experienced things as they really are and fractal universe fractal time I can take any one these beads like it expanded out into a birth and a death of a life-form and each of these beads are themselves beads strung out the days of a life strung out so in the same way fractal time same way we as human beings sleep and wake to a new day so it is that as god we die and awaken to a new life and that’s called reincarnation and another common idea behind all the mystery traditions is reincarnation so so reincarnation in in Judaism Kabbalah in Gnosticism and in Sufi traditions is another unifying idea so is reincarnation and the idea that one undivided indivisible soul goes hand-in-hand now I realize I’ve made a really eccentric and extreme made a kind of presented extreme idea and it’s so out there it’s it’s it’s almost like most people say it’s insane but I’m not trying to start a cult I’m basically trying to really start like a like a revolution and mental conceptions but what this explanation does it opens the way for other forms of spirituality and with mysticism because you can water down the explanation to seek your tastes so even though I believe it I believe in absolute mana some Advaita Vedanta that everyone’s God you can take that same explanation but you can actually modify it to your own tastes what it does do is it modifies its way it kind of makes possible a kind of resurgence of ancient mystical ideas that’s completely reasonable that’s more reasonable than scientific worldview Dex’s today so that’s a huge thing too and it’s very hard to challenge as well so basically we are talking about our complete revolution in mental conceptions and philosophy and science now just to finish off what we’re talking about it’s basically a complete return of ancient mystery religion that in this once you understand that mystery of consciousness and mystery of God have one of the same and that the brain theory extrapolates to the universe and that’s what was all one consciousness one claiming is that all the aspects of the brain theory in this table corresponds extrapolates and all the things in the universe but then also it brings back all these ancient mystical ideas once she understands one consciousness and they’re basically they’ve been talking about these aspects of God all along I’m saying as total correspondence with the brain theory with the universe as science understands it and also with all these ancient mystery tarnished traditions and what agent mystical ideas let us for another talk for another day now okay just an end it’s a stunning thing but basically it’s come full circle Dean I see dear so funny thinkers go science and philosophy came from the mystical and the sacred and religious you’re kind of the people who started science Einstein religion without science is blind science without religion is lame Einstein also said the sense of the mystical the true source of all science Isaac Newton wrote more about Kabbalah me and prophesized and about science he’s been called a first scientist also the last Magus and also Pythagoras who coined the word philosophy in a sense philosophy began with Pythagoras but Pythagoras was uber mystic worshiped as a living Gordon’s own lifetime really the the luminary of the Greek mysteries and also I can go on and on Leibnitz I mean all these kind of like people who really created philosophy were themselves mystics and people heavily into the mystery traditions and also the invisible college which gave rise to the Royal Society which has been called a midwife of modern science no institution based in London has done more to promote the modern scientific method than the invisible College an invisible College was a freemason meeting group led by Christopher Wren and Freemasonry really is esoteric religion in symbolized form and ideas get through so basically we come full circle in that science and philosophy came from the mystical and the transcendence has basically paved the way for this kind of fractal brain theory to emerge to bring about a complete return of the mystery and the sacred esoteric traditions so science far from being the enemy of religion was all along its friend and helper helping to dispel nonsense religion Super’s the religion of superstition and false rituals regulations to pave the way for the return of the true religion isn’t that a stunning ending before the end of the age is 26 thousand year cycle so basically we rectify what’s wrong science it’s purposelessness it’s meaninglessness we bring back the kind of like cooperation back to evolution so selfish genes Darwinism we’ve reaffirmed synergy cooperation and symbiosis and also we fix what’s wrong with philosophy we revitalize a field at Sloss its way we basically wrap up philosophy because all philosophy reduces the two questions and they are epistemology and ontology epistemology is the question how do we know what we know and basically all philosophical questions can be reduced idats why does the philosopher think he or she knows that but that’s not the last question because with we’ll have to ask what’s the nature of that which is asking the questions nature of existence ontology so ok a fear of the brain really is the final word a definitive theory of the brain is a final word on a question of epistemology but what we’ve shown is basically definitive answer to the ontological question on the side of idealism so so basically in a sense we lay foundations for philosophy for the 21st century and we we bring about the complete return of the ancient mystery religions so science religion and philosophy basically the intersection is found at mind brain consciousness and what the fractal brave here will bring about is a complete return and a full circle a complete unification of science religion and philosophy so it will be shown dat the garden the gaps that science has not yet explained mind brain consciousness is really where the true God was waiting to be discovered and revealed all along and also it will be shown that the newest of the new the most modern of the most modern the cutting edge of science in the form of a final brain theory and the absolute bleeding edge of high technology in the form of artificial intelligence and an L event of the technological singularity is also the return of the oldest of the old most ancient of the most ancient the perennial eternal indeed sacred and transcendence that you know at the end of this 26,000 year cycle how did the 2012 awakening happen maybe it happened because it was found a way was found to explain to people why he was asleep in the first place and also this idea that this these ideas can really come a start of revolution and mental conception to conclude 2012 fractal brain theory a kind of revelation of mind brain consciousness coming soon to a planet near you coming this year 2012 end of the age latter days would latter age thank you very much thank you very much<br> — Wai H Tsang</blockquote></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="3"><figure name="07f3" id="07f3" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow

It turns out that the synergistic information and the unique information can both show basically causal emergence in that they can grow at macro scale. So both the synergistic and unique information can be higher at macro scales and it’s just the redundant information that is basically keeping the mutual information from growing at higher scales.</blockquote><blockquote name="6480" id="6480" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">That makes perfect sense right which is that the micro scale there’s so much redundant information that it’s like you’re double counting the causally relevant information.

It’d be some incredible consilience. But overall they generally give the same manifold, particularly the ones that I think are kind of best. I know that that’s a bit subjective but there’s far more good ones than there are bad ones.

So the same thing is happening at the microscale and macroscale, but up in the macroscale you have a positive value and at the microscale you’ve got a negative value, it’s not just zero or a really low number. So you have like “super causal emergence” where the micro scale is actively trying to prevent the effect, and the macro scale is is doing it.</strong> I bring that up because some measures for example don’t go negative. So then in those cases you would have a clear disagreement where some would show “super causal emergence” and some would show it’s just zero.³</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="8b53" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="bfdd" id="bfdd" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Join us for discussion at our Peircean dedicated subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/triadomania/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/triadomania/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">/r/triadomania</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">.</em></p></div></div></section><section name="4e87" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="bdc5" id="bdc5" class="graf graf--figure graf--leading"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*41dD2voi90cyIrRF6njKaQ.png" data-width="224" data-height="224" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*41dD2voi90cyIrRF6njKaQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.44054.html" data-href="https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.44054.html" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Orpheus descending into Hades</a></figcaption></figure><p name="9c09" id="9c09" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--figure"><br></p><p name="10b8" id="10b8" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="3893" id="3893" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — </p><p name="98b9" id="98b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Trade-offs between Communicative Purposes</p><p name="5116" id="5116" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The additional constraints that come with more “real world” or action-oriented perspectives as in rhetoric as opposed to logic are concerned with such things as ethical constraints, efficiency-oriented constraints (e.g., pragmatic applicability aka <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">usefulness</em>), memorability (e.g. mnemonic power) and memetic virality. Some properties of replicating phenomena (here we are more concerned with cultural phenomena) that Richard Dawkins lists in his famous book The Selfish Gene also come to mind (i.e. longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">)</strong>.</p><p name="1807" id="1807" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The theoretical subdisciplines of science aren’t entirely pure of these additional purposes and they already adopt some relatively rhetorical modes already, for example theoretical physics tends to value mathematical elegance aka what I term <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the aesthetics of logic</em> (aesthetic constraints on norms of formal reasoning and communication).</p><p name="9634" id="9634" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The point here is that the literal or scientific mode works by abstracting away our other purposes and solely focusing on something like descriptive or predictive power.

I also think it might be true to say that, at least until somewhat recently, literal language and scientific truth tends to disregard scale and communication between different levels of description (there are of course exceptions).</p><h4 name="b228" id="b228" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Adding and Subtracting</h4><p name="ce84" id="ce84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Since metaphorical language is less theoretical and more practical and because of the additional constraints that come with the more “real world” focus, we are forced by the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">information bottleneck of action</em> to adapt or <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">encode</em> the information to better fit our purposes in at least two ways. First by irreversibly abstracting away (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lossy compression</a>) some informative information. Ideally this would be the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">least informative</em> of the non-redundant information. Second by adapting the information by adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mnemonic </a>information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaborative_encoding" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaborative_encoding" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">elaborative encoding</a>) that isn’t necessarily predictive knowledge. This could even involve idiosyncrasies that serve no other purpose than making it easier to remember and could be misleading if interpreted literally. An example of this is the anthropomorphisms of mythology and religion which take advantage of our bias towards agents and personalities.</p><p name="4d09" id="4d09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Prescientific traditions had less abstract concepts of accuracy and precision. They tend to package usefulness, efficiency and morality with truth. So they had more mixed and subtle ideas like wisdom. Modern scientific (provisional) truths make a trade off between the theoretical and the practical because it takes time to unpack the implications of theory.</p><p name="85b6" id="85b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Notice here I’m focusing on non-redundant information. I’m not entirely sure what to say about the subtraction of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">redundant </em>information, but I think in both literal and metaphorical language there would obviously be some amount of it as it would be generally necessary.</p><p name="f4f8" id="f4f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A distinction should be made though between encoding information for purposes of general communicative noise by adding redundant information and encoding information by adding knowledge (via information) that is in some sense untrue at some scale but valuable along another dimension other than a purely descriptive representation.</p><p name="08a4" id="08a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So in summary literal language serves less varied purposes (basically only “carving nature at its joints” + valuing precision) and thus tends to use <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">different means</em> of representing because of the associated trade-offs.</p><p name="07da" id="07da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The mistake was in thinking that they served the same single purpose.
