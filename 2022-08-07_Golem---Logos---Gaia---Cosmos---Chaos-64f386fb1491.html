There is meaning as in “the meaning of a sign” or meaning as in “the purpose of your personal life”, “the meaning of humanity” or even “the purpose of living organisms”. Lastly there is also the question of “what is the purpose of the universe?”</p><h4 name="75d6" id="75d6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">David Silver’s Answer on Lex Fridman Podcast #86</h4><p name="9268" id="9268" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A good answer that goes past biological evolution all the way to the arrow of time was given by Deep Mind’s David Silver on Lex Fridman’s podcast. He uses the conceptual model of a goal tree (a concept from AI) to explain how each novel subgoal/sub-purpose is created to help solve the problem of obtaining the higher level “parent” goal. This frames the idea of purpose in terms of ideas from computer science like search and optimization.</p><p name="4764" id="4764" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One very wide definition of intelligence is the ability to efficiently search the space of instrumental subgoals in order to find the means to accomplish a system’s higher-level goals.</p><p name="6344" id="6344" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can conceptualize these instrumental sub goals as “good” shortcuts, “good” biases or “good” constraints that reduce the time and effort to reach the subgoal and more importantly the final goal.</p><p name="37ce" id="37ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This subgoal view of intelligence seems to be inline with some of the unique qualities of human intelligence. In its modern form human intelligence could probably be distinguished along one line by its significantly higher level of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">indirection</em>. Humans communicate about objects that are very distant (even absent) from their present and more distant contexts, and this growth in indirectness of representation is also related to the exponential growth of mediating instrumental technology (i.e. subgoals).</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="2"><figure name="e2f1" id="e2f1" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p" style="width: 42.955%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*4OeBqTTQFnGMPNnKu-kd-w.jpeg" data-width="400" data-height="400" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*4OeBqTTQFnGMPNnKu-kd-w.jpeg"></figure><figure name="d701" id="d701" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure" style="width: 57.045%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*uk_iqQBvX2NXPrBprhyp2A.png" data-width="478" data-height="360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uk_iqQBvX2NXPrBprhyp2A.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption" style="width: 175.3%; left: -75.3%;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">(1)</strong> David Silver, principal research scientist at DeepMind. <strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">(2) </strong>An and–or tree is a graphical representation of the reduction of problems (or goals) to conjunctions and disjunctions of subproblems (or subgoals).

It is us trying to figure out our own reward function.</blockquote><blockquote name="2e62" id="2e62" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">You just kind of mentioned that if you want to build intelligence systems and you know what you’re doing you should be at least cognizant to some degree of what the reward function is. So the natural question is, what do you think is the reward function of human life, the meaning of life for us humans, the meaning of our existence?</blockquote><blockquote name="704d" id="704d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">David Silver</strong>:<br>I think you know I’d be speculating beyond my own expertise but just for fun let me do that. I think that there are many levels at which you can understand a system and you can understand something as optimizing for a goal at many levels. Let’s start with the universe, like does the universe have a purpose?</blockquote><blockquote name="3230" id="3230" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Well it feels like it’s just one level just following certain mechanical laws of physics and that’s led to the development of the universe. But at another level you can view it as actually that there’s the second law of thermodynamics that says that this is increasing in entropy over time forever. Now there’s a view that’s been developed by certain people at MIT that you can think of this as almost like a goal of the universe, that the purpose of the universe is to maximize entropy.</blockquote><blockquote name="4bf4" id="4bf4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">So there’s multiple levels at which you can understand a system. The next level down you might say well if the goal is to maximize entropy well how can that be done by a particular system, and maybe evolution is something that the universe discovered in order in order to dissipate energy as efficiently as possible. (By the way I’m borrowing from Max Tegmark for some of these metaphors.) But if you can think of evolution as a mechanism for dispersing energy, then evolution you might say becomes a goal.</blockquote><blockquote name="4f4a" id="4f4a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">If evolution disperses energy by reproducing as efficiently as possible, what’s evolution then? Well it’s now got its own goal within that which is to actually reproduce as effectively as possible. Now how is reproduction made as effective as possible well you need entities within that that can survive and reproduce as effectively as possible and so it’s natural in order to achieve that high level goal those individual organisms discover brains/intelligences which enable them to support the goals of evolution.</blockquote><blockquote name="f0f8" id="f0f8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Perhaps the early brains maybe they were controlling things at some direct level, you know maybe they were the equivalent of pre-programmed systems which were directly controlling what was going on and setting certain things in order to achieve these particular goals. But that led to another level of discovery which was learning systems, parts of the brain which were able to learn from themselves and learn how to to program themselves to achieve any goal. Presumably there are parts of the brain where goals are set to parts of that system and provides this very flexible notion of intelligence which is why we as humans presumably feel that we can achieve any goal.</blockquote><blockquote name="6a4a" id="6a4a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">So it’s a very long-winded answer to say that you know I think there are many perspectives and many levels at which intelligence can be understood and each of those levels you can take multiple perspectives that you can view the system as something which is optimizing for a goal which is understanding it at a level by which we can maybe implement it and understand it as AI researchers or computer scientists or you can understand it at the level of the mechanistic thing which is going on i.e. the atoms bouncing around in the brain, leading to the outcome of that system which is not in contradiction with the fact that it’s also a decision-making system that’s optimizing for some goal and and purpose<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="8bb4" id="8bb4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Lex Fridman</strong>:<br>I’ve never heard the description of the meaning of life structured so beautifully in layers, but you did miss one layer which is the next step which you’re responsible for, which is creating the the artificial intelligence layer on top of that. I can’t wait to see, well I may not be around, but they can’t wait to see what the next layer beyond that will be.</blockquote><blockquote name="dfcf" id="dfcf" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">David Silver</strong>:<br>Well let’s just take that that argument and pursue it to its natural conclusion. So the next level indeed is for how can our learning brain achieve its goals most effectively? Well maybe it does so by us as learning beings building a system which is able to solve for those goals more effectively than we can. So when I said that I wanted to build a system that can play go better than I can, I’ve enabled myself to achieve that goal of playing go better than I could buy buy directly playing it and learning it myself. So now a new layer has been created which is systems which are able to achieve goals for themselves.</blockquote><blockquote name="2bf3" id="2bf3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">Ultimately there may be layers beyond that where they set subgoals to parts of their own system in order to achieve those and so forth. So the story of intelligence is a multi-layered one and a multi perspective one. We live in an incredible universe.</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="a85a" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="f938" id="f938" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Commentary</h3><p name="b528" id="b528" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Speaking Across Nested Concepts<br></em>In order to understand such very wide interpretations of the phrase “meaning” or “purpose” and its <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">parent concepts</em> we need to describe something like a scaffolding of senses of the words, each level being more general than the last.

This will change the topic but it at least transitions the meaning to a subsuming context that can shed light on the included topic. One transition that does have terminology to go with it would be the abiotic to biotic transition (abiogenesis). A pre-transition term would be sometime like “irreversible process” while afterwards we shouldn’t be shy about talking about represented future possible states (i.e., purposes) even for simple bacteria.
