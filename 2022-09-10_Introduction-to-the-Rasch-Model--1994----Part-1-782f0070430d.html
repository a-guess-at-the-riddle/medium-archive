So I’m going to attempt to do that by using this pad of paper which I carefully filled out over the weekend. On which I put everything that I know. However whether I can make it all clear or not remains to be seen, and it may be that by and by that I will ask your help. But at least to start with I will tell my story and see how it turns out.</p><p name="9447" id="9447" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now what when I got started on this business in 1960 with my friend George Rasch, I just took it as it was a method for taking raw scores and turning them into measures, and it was useful and easy and produced pleasing results, and I was satisfied with that. But as I talked about it more and more and more I needed more and more of a reason for doing this. And so by and by I got it embedded in a philosophy of science. Now I always try to see it from that point of view because I like to see myself involved in a wide process not scrutinizing just a tiny thing on a desktop the before and after of which I have no awareness of.</p><figure name="f11a" id="f11a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*lQDJ2lJINs_i8EvIWkehUg.png" data-width="520" data-height="497" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lQDJ2lJINs_i8EvIWkehUg.png"></figure><h4 name="83ed" id="83ed" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Exposure</h4><p name="6908" id="6908" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">So I start out with science is what? <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Exposure</em></strong>. All I mean by that is consciousness/awareness.</p><p name="886e" id="886e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However exposure by itself doesn’t add up to anything. In fact it’s it’s gone as fast as it occurs. We have to make a point of some kind and that leads us to observation, and so I find it very important to differentiate between exposure and observation. Because it’s an observation that not only science but sanity begins. So I want to talk about that a little bit although in a sense it has nothing to do with the Rasch model as such or with algebra or anything like that.</p><h4 name="6f85" id="6f85" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Observation</h4><p name="2863" id="2863" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Observation</em></strong> is necessary in order to make measurements. Measurements are something we do with observations. So you might say, “well what’s wrong with the observations? Why don’t we just go directly from them to the analysis?</p><p name="372c" id="372c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why do we need <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">measurement in between</strong>?” and I want to make<br>a strong point of that. I hope I can make it clear to you why observation is necessary but not sufficient, and measurement, of course, can’t be done without observation, but it is also necessary for <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">analysis</strong>. And that in fact we don’t do any analysis without doing some kind of measurement with our observations, whether it’s explicit and well controlled or just accidental and implicit.</p><p name="8727" id="8727" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now after the measurements have been established at this point its <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">just one dimension</em>, one thing at a time, always a fiction because nothing is one thing at a time in its fullness, but nothing to think about can be more than one thing at a time otherwise we can’t think about it clearly.</p><p name="4270" id="4270" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So measurement is one dimension at a time. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Analysis </em></strong>is always more than one. It’s always a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">comparison</em> of two time points, before and after, input and output, cause and effect, or a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">relationship </em>between two different variables. So in a sense you could say analysis is always multivariate, if you’d like to use that kind of word, but I prefer to think of it as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">comparisons</em> and the analysis of process or <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">cause and effect</em></strong>.</p><p name="4514" id="4514" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, the reason for these activities which are the machinery of science is in order to think, and if you’re a scientist you call thinking theorizing. This elevates it to a somewhat higher plane, but I don’t think there’s anything of substantial difference between ordinary everyday thinking and theory. Perhaps theory is more carefully explained and made more public and so on but it is the same thing as thinking. And these arrows indicate the relationships between these parts. Observation leads to measurement, and measurement goes back to the observations and suggests that some of them might be improved. So there is a circle here, a spiral, hopefully evolutionary, that is, going up somewhere in which these two activities feed each other getting a smarter and smarter about the situation that they are directed towards.</p><p name="9820" id="9820" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then once you have measurement you may do some analysis with it, but there is really very little analysis can tell you about measurement and observation. If I look at the relationship between height and nutrition there is very little I can find out from nutrition which will show me how to measure height, and there’s very little I can find out about measuring height which is going to help me with nutrition. So there isn’t a feedback from analysis to measurement. That’s important to realize because many statistical techniques offered to social scientists are based on the premise that somehow the analysis will tell you about the measurement. It doesn’t work. The measurement tells you about the observations in ways I hopefully will become clear, but the analysis does not. The analysis takes it for granted that you’ve got the measurements, and that they’re doing what you say they’re doing, and you’re now looking at how they relate to each other.</p><p name="e103" id="e103" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Theory of course influences thinking as it were, influences all of these things. So that’s the basic process and the mnemonic for it is so <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">XOMAT</em></strong>. (e<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">X</strong>posure, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">O</strong>bservation, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">M</strong>easurement, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A</strong>nalysis, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">T</strong>heory)</p><p name="8e1a" id="8e1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Observation begins by noticing. But noticing is not enough. We have to make something of the noticing. Say we have to point. As soon as you point at something you are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">nominating</em> it for attention, and so it has in the S. S. Stevens vernacular nominal status. It has become something that you can point to. So you can also choose it, and the utility of pointing is to facilitate choosing. And the motivation for choice is whether the thing pointed at is pleasurable or painful. That’s where it begins.</p><p name="386e" id="386e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Very soon it becomes useful to name what you’re pointing at. So that you can tell yourself and others about what is a good choice in what is not. So the language of a pleasurable choosing depends ultimately on being able to name what you pointed at. So you give it a label of some kind. The label is just a word, “orange”. Well there’s lots more to this than that word, but since I’ve discovered that oranges are pleasurable to eat, and it’s good, I can point to them and say to myself, “I’m gonna eat one of those”, and I found out it’s good to eat. But if I want to tell Mike about it it would better to have a name for it, and agree what the name points to.</p><p name="9813" id="9813" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we put it into language, and then it becomes recallable (this has left cortex activity now) and repeatable, that is we can go and look for it, and usable. And now we have the development of this.</p><p name="fd62" id="fd62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is perceptual, this is motor. Having discovered that some things are pleasurable and somethings are painful, we use our muscles, our cerebellum, skeletal muscles, and motility to either get the pleasure or avoid the pain. That’s the theory of observation.</p><p name="fa57" id="fa57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The important thing to realize is that it is nominal and ordinal. That is even in the observation there’s an order: pleasure, pain; get, avoid. That is they don’t occur separately. Stephens says they are two things, but I think in neurological functioning if you name it you develop a choice about it.</p><p name="7739" id="7739" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Or to put it another way, we don’t spend much time naming things about which we have no choices. That’s not efficient. And once we know what’s pleasurable and painful we generally move ourselves to negotiate those things. So it’s nominal, ordinal and is qualitative. There’s nothing yet really numerical about it. We haven’t even started to count at this point.</p><p name="c534" id="c534" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s observation.</p><figure name="aa26" id="aa26" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*6js9foehb_qdYYeVl35JRw.png" data-width="414" data-height="365" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6js9foehb_qdYYeVl35JRw.png"></figure></div></div></section><section name="4388" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="9aa6" id="9aa6" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Now when you get to be scientific, you enhance this term with a model, and you say observation models. This means that you’re going to define a certain situation, an item, or an observation that you’re going to make, a scientific observation like the gross national product of each country or the<br>life expectancy of each country or how people answer a question <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2 + 3 =</strong> ?.</p><p name="4422" id="4422" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the hook, you go out and hook something. Observations models are supposed to be a hook that hooks up stuff that you want. It <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">identifies</em> an <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">indicative replication</em>. Now every one of those words is important. Pointing and naming is the identification. It’s supposed to indicate something you’re interested in. Some math items would indicate math ability. Life expectancy would indicate longevity, perhaps quality of life, consequences, and things like that. [Its] indicative and it has to be repeatable. If there’s only one math question you haven’t got anything. You need many questions in math to replicate the single searching idea, the line of inquiry, which is mathematics in general, and as soon as you say this you realize that these are indicative replications, but they’re only examples. They’re not the thing itself. They’re are only samples of the thing or examples of the thing. These define an<br>observation format which in its basic form looks like this:</p><p name="0df4" id="0df4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">X </em>= 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / …</strong></p><p name="ab20" id="ab20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">X</em></strong> is the data or the observation. What you’re looking for either occurred or it didn’t occur, or maybe it occurred more than that. You could be counting something here that you had named or this be could be some kind of a rating scale. Each of these categories have two characteristics. They have to have labels of some kind, and they have an ordinal structure.</p><p name="51c5" id="51c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So now we have something which is qualitative, nominal and ordinal, but it’s still very concrete. It’s something that happens or it doesn’t happen and after it’s happened it’s not happening again. It’s a piece of history. So since what we always want to know about is what’s next, this is never what we want to know about. But it’s the only way we can infer what we want to know about. This is the past from which we’re hoping to see the present and the future (let’s forget the present for a moment).</p><p name="09bd" id="09bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So while it isn’t what we want, it’s the only way to get there. That’s a very important thing to realize. I don’t want to know which questions you answered. I want to know how much math you know. But I can only find out by asking you some questions. So I have to find a way to make that leap from what I know but don’t want to what I want but can’t know. That’s called inference.</p><figure name="d0fc" id="d0fc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*CTVcqon8z0p7NKn-K8yrUQ.png" data-width="443" data-height="517" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CTVcqon8z0p7NKn-K8yrUQ.png"></figure></div></div></section><section name="16e9" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="a790" id="a790" class="graf graf--figure graf--leading graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jiaTz6C_k3sorXVsY9LYUw.png" data-width="1118" data-height="543" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jiaTz6C_k3sorXVsY9LYUw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Table 1 from S.

If it doesn’t occur whatever else occurs is called a wrong answer. There could be more than one right answer and more than one wrong answer but basically whatever happens I just say right or wrong or <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">absent</em>/<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">present</em>. One step, “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">X</strong>”, has two categories, but just one step, the categories are always ordered.</p><p name="53aa" id="53aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now here’s a two step one. Three category, two step.</p><p name="c218" id="c218" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Frown, non-responsive, and smile; or a little, some, a lot.</p><p name="9df0" id="9df0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And the important thing is these are proceeding in the direction of each time, but I’m not taking any statement about how big a step it is from a smile to a non-response or from a frown to a smile or how far it is from a little to some or from some to a lot.</p><p name="84f5" id="84f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those are things that I will find out later. That’s to be done later on. I want to know those things, but at this point I don’t take a stand it. All I say is that this is more than that and this is more than that. Some is more than a little, a lot is more than some.</p><p name="3bca" id="3bca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And we can go to three steps, four categories; <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Strongly Disagree </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">/ </strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Disagree </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">/ </strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Strongly Agree</em>, a very popular one; <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Never </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">/ </strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Sometimes </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">/ </strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Often </em>/ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Always</em> and on and on and on. But these could also be, if you could go further, these could actually be the life expectancies for each of the 72 countries in Pedro’s data. In which case they might be ordered in 72 steps. It might be that every country has a different life expectancy and I can go from the lowest to the highest and the 72 distinct values for the data. However right now I realize I don’t want all 72. That’s too many steps.</p><p name="c92b" id="c92b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So as we move into this, we start to realize that it isn’t better to have lots and lots of steps in the data. What you want to find out is the fewest number of steps that will do the job you want. You know that if you ask a person to differentiate on a hundred point scale the sweetness of this orange, that you’re gonna get lots of nonsense. Now maybe a five point scale you can get somewhere, but probably not any more than that. So one of the things you learn as you construct the measures from the observation models is you learn from the measure analysis how many steps in the observation model are productive. Two or three, four perhaps, usually are pretty productive. In most tasks involving human judgment it’s very hard to discover any evidence that more than four or five steps, that is five or six categories, are producing anything but noise, and fortunately the mathematical analysis of the data allows you to discern what is noise and what is informative. So that’s what that those arrows going back and forth between measurement and observation we’re about.</p><p name="2c16" id="2c16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The measurement will tell you how to modify your observation models so that they are more productive for you, take less time, are more accurate, provoke less confusion and so on.</p><p name="2da6" id="2da6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">An odd number of categories producing a middle, like for three or five, can often be difficult because many people will pick <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">this</em> center thing in order not to answer the question. So you won’t know whether they really mean halfway or whether they mean no dice. That elicits from your respondents an ambiguity which you can’t untangle. So in general it’s better to have an even number of categories if the categories are being addressed by a respondent so that they won’t duck out by going through the middle. It’s also by the same token you don’t want to offer them something to circle which says “not applicable” because if you’re asking them questions that don’t apply then you shouldn’t be asking them the questions. But if you’re asking the questions and they do apply then you shouldn’t give them a chance to refuse to respond. That isn’t productive. You need to learn, in fact, if you asked a question which people don’t like to respond to, you can learn by the confusion that occurs when they respond to that item from the chaos in their responses. So you don’t need to give them the non-applicable category.</p></div></div></section><section name="fd44" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="f543" id="f543" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I guess I should put up the the codeword here, well at least the middle part of it.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="166d" id="166d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">O</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">bservation</em></li><li name="5f95" id="5f95" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">M</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">easurement</em></li><li name="eab6" id="eab6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">A</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">nalysis</em></li></ul><p name="5033" id="5033" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">We were just talking about how the observation model while motivated prior to the measurement, can be informed and improved by the measurement analysis. So measurement is the yardstick, and whenever you’re working with a measurement problem don’t hesitate to go back to yardsticks. Make sure that the question you’re asking could be answered with a yardstick because if it can’t be answered with a yardstick you’re not going to be able to answer it.</p><p name="c253" id="c253" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You may be able to fake it and fool people, but you won’t. This is what measurement is, and if you can’t make whatever you’re doing to behave like a yardstick, you haven’t made a measurement yet. Now the interesting thing is almost everything sensible can be made into yardsticks. It’s amazing how many yardsticks can be made from the data for which people throw up their hands and say “Well this is just too many different things, I can’t possibly understand this.”</p><figure name="669c" id="669c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*k--4PSzoCINbwgvZe2Mqsw.jpeg" data-width="2100" data-height="1623" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k--4PSzoCINbwgvZe2Mqsw.jpeg"></figure><p name="daf0" id="daf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In Pedro’s case, why would you think that life expectancy, literacy rate and gross national product would measure the same things in over 72 countries?

So instead of deciding on the basis of some religion use do you suffer from it’s better to do the experiment and see what happens or the analysis will tell you.</p><p name="9e93" id="9e93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This this brings up something else about measurement models. Not only do they have to be very simple and very clear but they have to be very demanding. They should demand what you’re looking for so that if it’s not there you learn right away from the analysis because the model objects, and it says this is not what you’re looking for, do something about it. You don’t want models that are generous and permissive and just letting any old thing happen because then you’ll keep cooking garbage, and you’ll never know how to make a real good pot of soup. You want a tight recipe that says you only put in potatoes and onions, no shoes, no rotten fruit, and so on and so forth. That’s what you want.

Well, why would she let me do that, you see?

Just like coin flips are done. Probability theory was devised for this purpose.

We have to put a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">0</strong> on there, and we have to be able to count up equal units.

They’re palpable, but they’re over, there obsolete. This (measurement) is abstract, it’s eternal, but it’s not palpable. We can think it. We can we can represent it. But you see this (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">holds up yard stick</em>) is a representation of the idea of equal units with an origin right here (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">points to end of yard stick</em>), but these units are not actually equal. Anybody with a careful distance measuring device can convince anybody else that this ruler in fact is very uneven, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">if you look closely enough at it</em>.</p><p name="7bed" id="7bed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we realized now that the idea is perfect, but the representation is never perfect. No representation, nothing palpable is ever a perfect representation of the idea that motivates it and by which it is used. So we have to keep that in the background as we proceed. There is an asymmetry between these two things. The object can be as complicated as it wants to be, like my height. I’m relatively complicated, but my height is not complicated. My height is very simple. “thing — thing” (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Wright, compares the yard stick to his body height</em>). These inches here are the items by which I measure my height, and if you want to make it into a test you get this stick longer. Then you see which inches I pass (those are the inches below me) and which items I fail (those are the inches above me) and where my hair is it’s not quite clear. So there’s a certain amount of uncertainty in this region, and you can score me on this test. After you decide about where the average confusion is along here, you can say we will call that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ben’s height</em> and that will be some inches on this on this ruler and then you will call that my height. But it will be a fiction consider produced by the construction of this device and it’s very careful application in a certain way.</p><p name="5e60" id="5e60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you did it like this, I would get much taller or if you started up here I would get shorter. So there rules for how you use these things, and if you don’t follow the rules you won’t get useful results. So what that means is that anybody can ruin a Mercedes by driving it into the lake, but that doesn’t prove it’s a bad Mercedes or that Mercedes is a bad car. Mercedes just don’t work that way. It’s the same thing with for example a mathematics test. You can give a mathematics test in such a way as to ruin it. Like put a time limit on it which is too short and that’ll ruin it. Or print it in a language that the people who are taking it don’t speak. That’s that’s not just a joke because if you use very fancy English and you give it to children who don’t speak fancy English you may not find out how much math they know because they can’t read the questions.</p><p name="c638" id="c638" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is nearly as well watched after as you might expect it to be. But it’s a little bit like measuring height this way (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">holds yard stick diagonally</em>) instead of that way (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">holds stick vertically)</em>. So one of the things we need to work on is to make the rules for a sensible application of a measuring device as clear as possible or as obvious as possible, so that we won’t confuse ourselves and we get to the analysis stage and be analyzing numbers that don’t work right.</p><p name="326c" id="326c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somebody might still argue that why couldn’t we just count the things and use that.

Could I trade five of these for five of those would you make the trade? Why not? Because while these are oranges they’re not what? The same size. Well why do you care about that?

You can’t get a trade going unless both sides think it’s a fair deal, which means you have to have units that will work in that in that system. Bushel baskets might work, but then you got to watch out, what if they’re different sizes? So weight is even better, but as we move from bushel baskets, which are semi fiction, to weight which is a complete fiction, we realize to get the equity essential for commerce and trade we have to go to abstract units and to machines like this (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">picks up yard stick</em>) which maintain them well enough so everybody&#39;s satisfied. It has to be both parties that are satisfied. So whatever defects the device has to have they can’t be biased or prejudicial. They can’t favor one side or the other.
